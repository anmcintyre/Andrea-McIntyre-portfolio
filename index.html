	  <h1>Introduction</h1>
	  <p>I've been a programmer for almost 18 years now. I started with Lucent, which was bought out by Alcatel to become Alcatel-Lucent. Then, the Enterprise division was sold off to become Alcatel-Lucent Enterprise. For the last 15 years I have done web development,
	    first with ASP, then with Java/JSP. Of course I was using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and SQL along the way. </p>
	  <p>Most important to me is my family. I have two wonderful boys and an amazing husband. My awesome parents are in Florida.</p>

	  <p>Between a job and 2 boys, who has time for hobbies?</p>

	  <h2>What is your dream job?</h2>
	  <p>Web Development! I love coding, and have greatly enjoyed my previous years of development. I would love to find a job where I get to continue to develop code with the flexibility to maintain a healthy work-life balance.</p>

	  <h2>What is your background?</h2>
	  <p>I started coding in BASIC back in grade school. In high school I learned Fortran. In college, I learned C, and even took a class to find out what this Internet thing that people were beginning to talk about. My first three years out of college I worked
	    on a UNIX based application, but then was able to move to a web based application.</p>
